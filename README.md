Face-Recognition = Face recognition is a biometric technology that uses unique facial features to identify and verify individuals. The process involves detecting faces within images or video streams, aligning them to a standard position, extracting distinctive features, and creating a unique template or signature. This template is then compared to stored templates to find a match, enabling applications such as security and surveillance, identity verification, smart home devices, social media, and healthcare. However, face recognition also faces challenges like variability in lighting, pose and orientation, facial expressions, aging, and appearance changes, as well as potential biases and discrimination.
